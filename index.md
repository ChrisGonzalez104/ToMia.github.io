# Dear Mia,

Happy Valentine's Day Love! Oh My gosh I can't believe weve made it this far. These past 6 months with you have been the happiest I've ever been. I love you so much. I've always heard that having a healthy relationship is hard, which it is sometimes, but it's one million percent worth it if i'm able to be with you. You have no idea how much you matter to me. Everything I do is for a future with you and me together. On the hardest days, looking at a picture of you is enough to remind me what I'm working towards. Youre my best friend and if I could have you to talk to for the rest of my life I'd give up anything to make that possible. I know at times I can be really difficult and I appreciate how much you accept me, and help to make me a better person. The effort you put into us, the love you show to me, my family, and my friends doesn't go unnoticed. I love how much you care about me and your love means the world to me. You're my best friend, my girlfriend, my mom at times, but most of all you're the love of my life. I love everything about you. Every inch of your body, every cute thing you do and say, every trait you have, good and bad. I love you, your family, and your friends. You're an amazing person Mia and if no one else, I will always support and love you. Happy Valentine's Day Love!
